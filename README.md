# Employee Management System Backend

This is the backend of an Employee Management System built with Java Spring Boot. It provides RESTful APIs for managing users, roles, and employees. The system includes JWT authentication for secure login and role-based access control. The UI for this system can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Adikumaw/EMS-UI)."

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure login system using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Role-Based Logins**: Access control based on user roles.
- **User Management**: CRUD operations for users and their accounts.
- **Role Management**: CRUD operations for roles.
- **Employee Management**: CRUD operations for employees, including specific employee retrieval by ID.

## Technologies Used

- Java Spring Boot
- JWT for Authentication
- Spring Security for Role-Based Access Control
- MySQL (or your preferred database)
- Maven
